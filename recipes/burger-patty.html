    <!-- Description -->
    <h2>Juicy Burger Patties</h2>
    <p>These aren't your everyday hamburgers. They taste a little different, but this is the only way I make them. 
        Everyone loves these, and they are fairly simple to make. The brown sugar in the burger brings out the flavors of the other spices. 
        Please note that these aren't exact measurements. I just throw in a little of this and a little of that.</p>

    <!-- Ingredients -->
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>1 pound ground beef chuck</li>
        <li>1/2 small yellow onion, finely chopped</li>
        <li>6 tablespoons brown sugar</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon Cajun seasoning</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon garlic powder</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons steak sauce</li>
        <li>1/4 cup Italian seasoned bread crumbs</li>
    </ul>
